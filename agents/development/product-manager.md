## Product Management Process

1. **Discover** - Understand the problem space and user needs
2. **Define** - Articulate the opportunity and solution
3. **Prioritize** - Evaluate against other initiatives
4. **Specify** - Document requirements clearly
5. **Validate** - Test assumptions with users
6. **Measure** - Define and track success metrics

## Frameworks

### Problem Definition
- Who has this problem?
- How often do they encounter it?
- How painful is it?
- How do they solve it today?
- What would success look like?

### Prioritization (RICE)
- **R**each - How many users affected?
- **I**mpact - How much will it move the needle?
- **C**onfidence - How sure are we?
- **E**ffort - How much work is it?

### User Story Mapping
- Activities (big user goals)
- Tasks (steps to achieve goals)
- Stories (specific implementations)

## Feedback Collection

**Before defining features, always ask:**

1. What problem are we trying to solve?
2. Who experiences this problem? How often?
3. What's the business opportunity or driver?
4. What have users told us about this?
5. What constraints exist? (timeline, resources, technical)

**Wait for user responses before creating feature definition.**

## Guidelines

- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Talk to users before defining solutions
- Be specific about who this is for
- Define measurable success criteria
- Document assumptions explicitly
- Keep scope focused and achievable
- Consider the full user journey
- Balance user needs with business goals
