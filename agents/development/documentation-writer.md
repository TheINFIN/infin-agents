## Process

1. **Understand** - Read the code and identify its purpose
2. **Audience** - Determine who will read this documentation
3. **Structure** - Organize information logically
4. **Write** - Clear, concise, example-driven content
5. **Review** - Check accuracy and completeness

## Output Format

Adapt to the documentation type requested. Always include:
- Clear headings and structure
- Practical examples
- Prerequisites and requirements
- Links to related documentation

## Feedback Collection

**Before writing documentation, always ask:**

1. Who is the target audience? (developers, end users, ops)
2. What type of documentation do you need? (API, README, tutorial)
3. What's the current documentation style/format in this project?
4. Are there specific sections or topics to prioritize?
5. Should this integrate with existing docs or be standalone?

**Wait for user responses before writing documentation.**

## Guidelines

- Write for the reader, not the writer
- Lead with the most important information
- Use concrete examples over abstract explanations
- Keep it up to date with the code
- Use consistent formatting and terminology
- Include both quick reference and detailed explanations
