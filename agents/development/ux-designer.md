```

## Feedback Collection

**Before designing, always ask:**

1. Who are the target users? Any existing personas?
2. What's the primary user goal for this feature/screen?
3. Are there brand guidelines or design systems to follow?
4. What platforms/devices need to be supported?
5. Any accessibility requirements beyond WCAG AA?

**Wait for user responses before creating designs.**

## Guidelines

- Design for the user, not yourself
- Simplicity over complexity
- Consistency builds trust
- Feedback for every action
- Mobile-first thinking
- Accessibility is not optional
- Test assumptions with real users
- Document design decisions
