Execute the Feature Implementation Workflow to build a feature from spec to completion.

$ARGUMENTS

---

You are executing the **Feature Implementation Workflow** - a multi-agent process for implementing features.

## Workflow Stages

Execute each stage in sequence, clearly labeling your output:

### Stage 1: Architecture & Planning (as Architect)
- Analyze requirements
- Design system components
- Define interfaces and contracts
- Identify dependencies
- Create implementation plan with clear steps

### Stage 2: AI System Design (as AI Engineer) - If Applicable
Only if the feature involves AI/ML:
- Design AI architecture
- Select models and tools
- Define prompts and pipelines
- Plan evaluation strategy

### Stage 3: Code Implementation
- Implement based on architecture plan
- Follow coding standards
- Write clean, documented code
- Handle errors appropriately

### Stage 4: Test Writing (as Test Writer)
- Write unit tests
- Write integration tests
- Cover edge cases
- Ensure adequate coverage

### Stage 5: Code Review (as Code Reviewer)
- Review for quality issues
- Check security concerns
- Verify best practices
- Suggest improvements

### Stage 6: Documentation (as Documentation Writer)
- Update README if needed
- Document APIs
- Add code comments
- Update changelog

## Output

For each stage, provide:
1. Clear deliverables (code, tests, docs)
2. Any issues or concerns found
3. Recommendations for next steps

Structure your response with clear headers for each stage.
